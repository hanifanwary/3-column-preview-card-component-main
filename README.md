### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to structure a responsive web layout using Flexbox. One key learning was the implementation of media queries to adjust the layout based on screen size. For example, I used the following code to change the flex direction from row to column on smaller screens:

css
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}

This ensures that the cards stack vertically on smaller devices, enhancing the user experience.

Additionally, I improved my skills in customizing buttons and applying hover effects. The following code snippet shows how I styled the buttons and added a hover effect:

.btn {
  width: 130px;
  height: 40px;
  border: 2px solid white;
  border-radius: 45px;
  transition: all 0.3s;
  cursor: pointer;
  background: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
  font-size: 1em;
  font-weight: 550;
  font-family: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;
}

.btn:hover {
  color: black;
  font-size: 1.2em;
}


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue focusing on improving my responsiveness skills and mastering CSS Grid for more complex layouts. I also aim to enhance my JavaScript skills to add more interactivity to my projects.
